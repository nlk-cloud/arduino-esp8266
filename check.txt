check:

In settings.h 
    mqttClientid on line 21
    should AAda_MQTT_Enable be replaced with node-red enable?

Webpage.h is not edited. Is it needed?
WebserverSetup.h is not edited. Is it needed?
JSON.h -- some parameters are converted to string ( refer to the end of the file). Not sure why. Hence commented them
